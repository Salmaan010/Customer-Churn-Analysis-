**Project Overview:**

The Customer Churn Analysis project focuses on identifying and analyzing factors that influence customer churn. This project helps businesses understand key indicators of churn and design strategies to improve customer retention. By analyzing customer demographics, services subscribed to, and payment methods, it helps create a data-driven approach to address churn risk.

**2. Customer Risk Analysis Dashboard:**

   - **Churn Rate:** 

     - The overall churn rate is **26.54%**, meaning **1869 out of 7043** customers left the company last month.

     - **Fiber Optic users** show a higher churn rate (**41.89%**), while **DSL (18.96%)** and **No Internet service (7.4%)** users have lower churn rates.

     - **Month-to-month contracts** have the highest churn rate (**42.71%**).

     - Longer contracts show decreasing churn rates, with **6-year contracts** showing the least churn.
   
   - **Years of Contract:**

     - Churn is highest within the first year (**47.44%**) and decreases significantly for customers with contracts of **3-6 years**.

**Key Insights:**

- **High churn in the first year**: Over **55%** of customers who leave do so within the first year of their subscription. Improving customer engagement and support during this period could reduce churn.
  
- **Contract type affects churn**: Customers with **month-to-month contracts** are more likely to churn than those with **longer-term contracts**. Offering better incentives for longer contracts could mitigate this.

- **Senior citizens and dependents churn less**: Customers without dependents or partners are more likely to leave than those who have them.

- **Fiber Optic users have higher churn rates**: Customers using **Fiber Optic Internet** are at a higher risk of churn compared to DSL users or those without internet services.

- **Payment method influences churn**: Customers who use **Electronic Check** as a payment method are more likely to churn. Simplifying payment processes could help reduce churn.

- **Service dissatisfaction leads to churn**: Lack of services such as **Tech Support**, **Device Protection**, and **Online Security** contributes to customer dissatisfaction, causing churn. Improving these services might help in retaining customers.


**Future Enhancements:**

- **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing machine learning algorithms to predict which customers are likely to churn based on their current behavior.

- **Customer Retention Strategy**: Developing tailored strategies for different customer segments to reduce churn.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Adding a layer of analysis using customer feedback to understand the reasons for dissatisfaction.
